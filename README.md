# SCCM-MECM-Network
How I created a virtualized SCCM/MECM Network.

This projects main purpose was to give me a better understanding of how companies use SCCM/MECM to administer different devices and computers on their network.

With the completion of this project, I now carry System Administrator abilities and feel confident in administrating and creating enterprise networks with SCCM/MECM. 

I hope this project can be of help to someone who wants to learn more about SCCM/MECM and build their own virtualized enviornment.
